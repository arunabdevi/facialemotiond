# facialemotiondetection
Facial emotion detection using deep learning involves developing a model to classify emotions based on facial expressions. The implementation begins with data collection, typically using datasets like FER-2013 or CK+. Data preprocessing steps include face detection, resizing, and normalization. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is then designed and trained on these preprocessed images. Key layers include convolutional layers for feature extraction, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connected layers for classification. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with target benchmarks often set around 70-90% accuracy. Model performance is validated using a separate test set, and further tuning is performed to optimize results. The final model is integrated into applications for real-time emotion detection, providing outputs like happy, sad, angry, etc., with responsive system feedback.
